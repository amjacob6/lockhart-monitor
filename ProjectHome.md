# Description: #
The app is intended for use in clinical settings where medical practitioners can assess and monitor the health of patients by measuring gait speed and postural stability. This non-invasive mobile sensor technology will serve as a monitoring and diagnostic tool to quantify “frailty” associated with physiological deterioration.

# User Demographics: #
The app will be used by medical practitioners in hospital settings for mobility monitoring of at risk patients. The medical practitioner is expected to have limited computer proficiency so app has to be simple and effective in communicating the pertinent and critical information to the practitioner.
